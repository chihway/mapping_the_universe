# mapping_the_universe
This repository contains basic tutorials for working with cosmic survey data.

The repository is a collaboration between UHawaii (Eric Baxter) and UChicago (Chihway Chang). There are two parts of the repository. The "Basic" branch should provide teaching aids that give young students (high school and undergraduate) the opportunity to get hands on experience with real data from cosmic surveys. The "Advanced" branch provides basic tools for astronomy graduate-level examples to get started on using survey datasets for cosmology analyses. The latter is also associated with [these notes] and will be used in the UChicago graduate course "ASTR340: Statistical Methods in Astrophysics".
